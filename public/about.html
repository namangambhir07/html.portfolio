<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Naman Gambhir, a first-year B.Tech student with a passion for web development. My journey into tech started with a simple curiosity about how websites work. 
   As I began learning, I discovered the endless possibilities of creating dynamic, user-friendly websites, and I quickly developed a love for coding.
   This passion has led me to focus on web development, with the goal of mastering both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>

<p>Currently, I am diving into the fundamentals of web development, from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to exploring more advanced concepts.
  This website is my very first project, and I’ve put in my best effort to showcase my skills and document my learning process.
  Through personal projects and constant practice, I am building a strong foundation for a career in web development,
  with a focus on becoming a full-stack developer.</p>

  <p>I am committed to continuous growth, always exploring new tools, frameworks, and best practices. 
  Whether it’s learning a new programming language or working on a new project, 
  I believe in hands-on experience as the best way to improve. This website will serve as a place where 
  I can share my projects, experiments, and progress, and also connect with other developers and like-minded individuals.</p>

  <p>Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope my work inspires you as much as I’ve been inspired by the world of web development.
  I look forward to building amazing things and continuing my journey to becoming a well-rounded web developer.</p>
